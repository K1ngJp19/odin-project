                <h1>Conan Edogawa</h1>
                <P>Conan Edogawa is the alias used by Shinichi Kudo in his shrunken form. <br>Shinichi took the
                    appearance
                    of
                    his six or seven-year-old self after being <br> exposed to a prototype poison called APTX 4869,
                    which he
                    had
                    been forced to <br> swallow by two men in black later revealed to be members of the Black
                    Organization. <br> The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and
                    therefore <br>
                    he still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive ability of his teenage self. <br>
                    Conan's goal is to hunt down the Black Organization and have them arrested for their crimes, <br> as
                    well
                    as find an antidote to the APTX 4869. To do so he plans to make the washout detective <br> Kogoro
                    Mouri
                    famous in hopes of attracting cases related to the Black Organization.
